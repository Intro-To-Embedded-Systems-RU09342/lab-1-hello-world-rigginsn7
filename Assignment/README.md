# LAB 1
For this lab I explored the mathamatical functions in C. The functions I used were addition, subtraction Multiplication, division, remainder, shift left, shift right, bitwise AND, bitwise OR, bitwise XOR, and bitwise NOT.

## Dependencies
The library I used was MATH_C this gave me assess to use for mathamtical operations that aren't given to use initially.
